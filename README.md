# tmdb-movies

# This project is made by ReactJS, Tailwindcss, Ant Design and Framer Motion for animation.

- I created this project to practice my skills in reactjs and to familiarize with tailwindcss and antd. Also, to practice using Git.

- I use The Movie Database API to display all the movies and useEffect to fetch the data.

- This is responsive from 280px to 1920px.
